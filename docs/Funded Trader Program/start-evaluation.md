## How Evaluation Works

During evaluation:

- You trade using your locked collateral.
- You must reach both:
  - The required trading volume
  - The required net PnL target

Both conditions must be satisfied to qualify.

There are no daily loss limits or maximum drawdown rules.

---

## Outcomes

### 1️⃣ You Reach Volume + PnL Targets

If you successfully reach both targets:

- Your locked collateral is returned.
- Your evaluation profits are returned.
- You become eligible to claim a funded account.

Your evaluation capital is refunded before funding activation.

---

### 2️⃣ You Lose Your Locked Collateral

If your trading results in losses and your collateral is depleted:

- The evaluation ends.
- There are no refunds.

You may start a new evaluation at any time.

## Important Notes

- Evaluation capital is non-refundable unless targets are achieved.
- Targets must be achieved in full (both volume and net PnL).
