# How to Claim TORCH Airdrop

What this page does:
Checks your wallet’s eligibility from our bot screening, then routes you to human.tech to get a Humanity Score. Your next step depends on that score.

## Step 1 — Check your Wallet

Connect your wallet on the [airdrop checker](https://app.overlay.market/airdrops).

We’ll show one of two pre-screen statuses from our bot checker:

* Qualified (pre-screen passed) → proceed to Humanity Score (Step 2).
* Disqualified (pre-screen failed) → you can appeal via [Discord](https://redrct.overlay.market/discord) ticket.

## Step 2 — Humanity Score (via human.tech)

Complete the quick verification on [Human Passport](https://app.passport.xyz/#/dashboard). Based on your Humanity Score:

* ≥ 30 — Verified Human
  - Your wallet will be added to the next airdrop batch.
  - Claim on Sablier opens \~3 days later.

* 20–29 — Review Required (likely bot)
  - Open a [Discord](https://redrct.overlay.market/discord) ticket to appeal. If approved, we’ll add you to the batch and you’ll claim later on Sablier.

* < 20 — Bot. 
  - No further action. These wallets are not eligible.

> Note: Only qualified wallets can reach the Humanity Score step. Disqualified wallets can appeal directly via [Discord](https://redrct.overlay.market/discord).
