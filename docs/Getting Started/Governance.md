Overlay Protocol is under the governance of PlanckCat DAO, and in the future, OVL token holders will have voting rights. 

The votig weights will be as following:
- One PCD NFT equates to 100,000 votes, while one OVL token equals one vote within the governance structure. It's important to note that this equilibrium may be subject to change in the future.

PlanckCat DAO is a DAO created for Overlay contributors to engage in protocol governance through PlanckCat (PCD) NFTs, and play central role in governance.

The Governance will hold the authority to determine which markets are listed or delisted on the protocol, as well as to establish protocol risk parameters that influence the user experience for all participants.

It's important to emphasize that individuals who do not hold PCD NFTs can still actively engage in discussions on Discord and the Governance Forum.
