# OVL

OVL is the proposed native token of Overlay Protocol. It is an ERC-20 token on the Arbitrum Mainnet. OVL serves a dual purpose and will be used to participate in trading and DAO governance after launch.

OVL may be used by holders to:



1. vote on governance proposals of the DAO governing Overlay Protocol
2. open positions on the markets offered on Overlay by using OVL as collateral


## Building Position

To enter a position, a user of Overlay Protocol will lock OVL into the Overlay smart contract as collateral/margin. A user could leverage this collateral on either side of any market offered by Overlay. 

On closing a position, the position could either be profitable, unprofitable or at a break even. If the position is profitable, the protocol will mint OVL tokens equivalent to the delta difference of the market between build and unwind. These tokens are added to the circulating supply of OVL. 

If the position is unprofitable, the protocol burns OVL tokens of a value equivalent to the loss sustained. These tokens are removed from the circulating supply of OVL. No tokens are minted or burned in case a position is closed at a break even.  


## Governance

Currently, Overlay Protocol is governed by Planck Cat DAO NFT and OVL holders. One PCD NFT equates to 100,000 votes, while one OVL token equals one vote within the governance structure. It's important to note that this equilibrium may be subject to change in the future. PlanckCat DAO is a DAO created for Overlay contributors to engage in protocol governance through PlanckCat (PCD) NFTs, and currently plays a central role in governance. Discussions are ongoing regarding the potential transition of governance responsibilities to OVL token holders. These discussions are taking place within the appropriate channels on Discord and the Forum.


## Supply

Total supply of OVL is 800 million. The OVL supply, by function, is dynamic. Thus, OVL will be dynamically minted and burned by the smart contracts when positions are unwound by users.
