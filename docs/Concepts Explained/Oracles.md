# Oracles

Pricing data on Overlay markets is based on values intermittently fetched from oracles. Oracles are third-party services that help protocols get information/data (related to price data or other data) required from outside of the protocol’s smart contract ecosystem. Any tool that helps get price data about an asset is a “price oracle.” Overlay has the ability to onboard nearly any oracle, as long as the oracle feed is non-manipulable and non-predictable.
