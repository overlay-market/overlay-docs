# Contract Addresses



> INFO     
> Overlay Protocol is currently exclusively accessible to participants in the gated and sandboxed Litter Box programs. There have been three different versions of gated programs in the past. To stay informed about future private versions and the full launch, please follow updates on our official channels and actively participate in forum discussions.




## OVL Token

The OVL token is a native protocol on Arbitrum. Governance proposals and voting on the protocol are conducted using OVL tokens on the Arbitrum network. The OVL token contract address on Arbitrum is: 0x4305C4Bc521B052F17d389c2Fe9d37caBeB70d54. 

The old Ethereum contract: 0xdc77acc82cce1cc095cba197474cc06824ade6f7 (OVL holders on Ethereum can also participate in governance proposals and voting).

Please note that as of now, the OVL token is not available on any exchanges, and no liquidity pools have been deployed for it. It is currently intended for use within the sandboxed and gated Litter Box program on Arbitrum. 

If you have any further questions or need additional information, don't hesitate to reach out through our official communication channels.
 


## Overlay Smart Contracts

Overlay smart contracts are currently deployed only on the Arbitrum mainnet exclusively for testing purposes.

## PlanckCat DAO on Arbitrum

PlanckCat DAO (PCD) is a DAO that enables Overlay contributors to be involved in decision making processes through governance.

The contract address for the PCD NFTs is _[0xc9B28946144E3A0e02fcC119a622E30565916784](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xc9B28946144E3A0e02fcC119a622E30565916784)_.
